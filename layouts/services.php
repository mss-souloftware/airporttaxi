                    A 'Meet and Greet' service can be arranged when booking whereby the driver will be in arrivals with the passenger's name or company name, whichever you prefer. A comforting thought, especially for first time visitors in a foreign country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your flight is early or subject to delays, we will track your flight's progress and send your driver at the new expected time of arrival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of our work is corporate based so if you are booking a taxi for other people you need not worry, we will give them the professional quality service they would expect. We accept most major credit cards and debit cards and send receipts via email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OTS also welcomes corporate account customers and, subject to credit references, weâ€™ll be happy to offer you a monthly invoicing facility or direct debit on our airport taxi services.
